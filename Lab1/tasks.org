* [Ceasar-Cipher]
Modify the program to perform rot-3, rotation by 3 characters (or the traditional Caesar-cipher).

    Extend the program to print out each character of the ciphered text one per line instead of all the characters on one line.

    Extend the program to print out on each line not only the ciphered character, but also the original character too.

    Extend the program to print out on each line not only the original and ciphered characters, but also the "position" of the character in the text.

    Extend the program to handle both upper-case and lower-case letters.

    The program rotate.c requires 4 C-preprocessor #include directives to read the declarations of some standard C functions from C header files. Remove (and eventually replace) each #include line, in turn, to determine which required functions are declared in each file.
