** Money
Write a function named money that accepts
- a single integer parameter that represents a total number of cents,
and breaks the total down into its numbers of dollars and cents.

Your function should calculate the number of:
- dollars, and
- the number of "left-over" cents, and
- provide these to its calling function through its parameters.

For example, a value of 524 should be "returned" as 5 dollars and 24 cents.

Your function should have the prototype:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
void money(int total, int *dollars, int *cents);
#+END_SRC

and called as:
#+BEGIN_SRC
money(524, &dollars, &cents);
#+END_SRC
